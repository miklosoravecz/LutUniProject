### LutUni:Software Development Skills: Front-End 2020-21
> In this project I made a fictive restaurant website as a reference work for a front-end course. I used JavaScript and Sass for pure CSS styling. The project contains:

- Page navigation

- Responsive styles with CSS

- Flexbox and CSS Grid

- SCSS mixins and functions

- Changible color themes

- The app is deployed to GitHub

> I used express server to be able to run with Node and I used prettier npm package for automatic text formatting. I also used imported Font Awesome icons and Google Fonts font types.
