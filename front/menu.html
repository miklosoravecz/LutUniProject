          <p class="grid-p">
            Goulash is one of the most famous dishes from the Hungarian culinary
            repertoire, yet even today there are severe misconceptions about the
            original version of this iconic food. The name derives from the
            gulyás (herdsmen), who made their rich and fulfilling dish in a
            kettle over an open-fire.
            <br />
            Today, a kettle made goulash is considered as the most authentic
            version of all. Goulash has a long history going back to the ninth
            century, but only during the 1800s did it turn into a national
            symbol and a tool for preserving Hungarian identity.

          <p class="grid-p">
            Fisherman’s soup holds a similarly prominent place among the
            national dishes and, like goulash, it is cooked in a kettle over an
            open fire. The soup is prepared from mixed river fish (carp,
            catfish, perch or pike) and with a great amount of hot paprika,
            giving it the characteristic bright red color.
            <br />
            <br />
            It has numerous varieties, with a la Baja (made with thick pasta and
            mainly carp) or Szeged (made with four types of fish) being the most
            famous.

          <i class="dish-icon fas fa-utensils fa-3x"></i>
          <p class="grid-p">
            Hungarians’ all-time favorite dish is unquestionably lángos: a
            deep-fried flat bread that is certainly something to avoid on a
            diet. Lángos (deriving from the word flame) is served as a
            satisfying alternative to bread. The origins of lángos are thought
            to be due to Turkish influence, while others believe it comes from
            the ancient Romans.
            <br />
            What makes it so beloved is the endless varieties of toppings that
            come with it. It is usually eaten with garlic sauce, cheese, tejföl
            (sour cream), or even sausages.

          <p class="grid-p">
            Palacsinta is basically a crêpe that can be both sweet (I have had
            some fantastic sweet ones in Prague) and savoury, like in this case.
            These crêpes are filled with a delicious meat sauce, covered with
            some more sauce mixed with sour cream and then baked.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Trust me when I say they are mouth watering. I made them with veal,
            but they can be made with beef, chicken or pork too, or a mix of
            those. Serve them with an extra dollop of sour cream and a green
            salad on the side for a delicious meal!

            A delicious, unmissable dessert made from sponge cake, layered with
            chocolate cream, walnut kernel, rum and whipped cream on the top.
            Its history goes back to 1950, when the legendary Gundel
            Restaurant’s headwaiter (Károly Gollerits) envisioned this novel
            dessert. However, the first publicly tasted cake was made only in
            1958 by Béla Szőcs, master confectioner, whose cake became an
            award-winner at the Brussels World’s Fair.
            <br />

            Since the creator’s family keeps the original recipe secret, somlói
            galuska made elsewhere varies in form and preparation but always
            maintains the same fundamental ingredients.

          <p class="grid-p">
            Debreceni kolbász is a Hungarian sausage made with pork and spices
            such as garlic, paprika, pepper, and marjoram, which account for the
            reddish-orange color of the sausage. It is named after the Hungarian
            town of Debrecen. These sausages are typically unsmoked or lightly
            smoked, and the flavor is strong and slightly pungent.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            They can be broiled, baked, or fried. Some use them as an ingredient
            in various aromatic stews or bake the sausages with beans. Nowadays,
            Debreceni kolbász is popular throughout the former Austro-Hungarian
            Empire.
