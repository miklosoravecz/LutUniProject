          Hungarian cuisine is mostly continental Central European, with some
          elements from Eastern Europe such as the use of poppy, and the
          popularity of kefir and quark. Paprika is often associated with
          Hungary and is used prominently in several dishes. Typical Hungarian
          food is heavy on dairy, cheese and meats, similar to that of
          neighboring Czech, Polish, and Slovak cuisines. Chicken, pork and beef
          are common, while turkey, duck, lamb, fish and game meats are mostly
          eaten on special occasions.

          Hungary is also known for relatively inexpensive salamis and sausages
          it produces primarily from pork, but also poultry, beef and others.
          Bread is perhaps the most important and basic part of the Hungarian
          diet. It is eaten at all meals, accompanying main dishes. Before the
          fall of communism in 1990, white bread was a staple food. Numerous
          other types of baked goods, such as buns and pastries both salty and
          sweet, often creatively filled, have proliferated in recent years.

        <h2 class="sm-heading">Main dishes</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Main dishes may "require" a side dish or not. It is unusual to violate
          this convention. The side dish is most commonly potato in various
          styles, but rice or steamed vegetables are also popular. Some foods
          have a customary side dish (e.g., 'paprika chicken' is almost always
          eaten with noodles, while others may take any side dish (e.g., 'fried
          cheese'). Some dishes also have toppings or bread on the side
          considered almost mandatory, for example the sour cream and bread with
          'stuffed cabbage'. Recently, Hungarian chefs have become more
          creative, so Hungarian dishes prepared for tourists may seem unusual
          to Hungarians who familiar with more traditional preparations.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Goulash, often imagined as the quintessential Hungarian dish, is not
          eaten very frequently. Other famous Hungarian meat stews include
          paprikás, a thicker stew with meat simmered in thick, creamy,
          paprika-flavored gravy, and pörkölt, a stew with boneless meat
          (usually beef or pork), onion, and sweet paprika powder, both served
          with nokedli or galuska (small dumplings). In some old-fashioned
          dishes, fruits such as plums and apricots are cooked with meat or in
          piquant sauces/stuffings for game, roasts and other cuts. Various
          kinds of noodles, dumplings, potatoes, and rice are commonly served as
          a side dish. Hungarian dry sausages and winter salami are also widely
          eaten.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Other characteristics of Hungarian cuisine are the soups, casseroles,
          desserts, and pastries and stuffed crêpes, with fierce rivalries
          between regional variations on the same dish (such as the Hungarian
          hot fish soup called fisherman's soup or halászlé, cooked differently
          on the banks of Hungary's two main rivers: the Danube and the Tisza),
          palacsinta (pancakes served flambéed in dark chocolate sauce filled
          with ground walnuts) and Dobos Cake (layered sponge cake, with
          chocolate buttercream filling and topped with a thin layer of crunchy
          caramel).
